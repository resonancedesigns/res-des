Likewise, as both designer and developer, I can produce designs that take into consideration their technological implementation; such as usability and performance, lending to an improved user experience and potential cost savings without having to sacrifice standards. This helps streamline the process and bridge the gap between the desired functionality and final design of a project.</p>

                                        <p>In my past experience as a freelancer and working for agencies I have also obtained an eye for detail and appreciation for design, knowledge of new techniques and technologies for developing server-side, as well as knowing how to efficiently project manage and work with clients and colleagues successfully, including acting as a intermediary between development and design teams.</p>

                                        <p>I create websites that allow the user to experience a website in the best and most appropriate way suited to the device they are using. By working using progressive enhancement, a website is delivered with a responsive layout that can best make use of the space available on the smallest to largest devices. Cross browser compatibility is ensured by using feature detection so older browsers still in use today provide a solid experience, whilst modern browsers can go the next step and enhance the users time spent on your site.</p>

I write custom functionality for websites via JavaScript and HTML APIs, deliver dynamic content by building database driven sites with PHP &amp; MySQL, create applications that rely on real-time data and multiple asynchronous connections with Node.js such as chat and instant messaging web apps, build highly modular and performance driven applications that maintains a high volume of data such as e-commerce and content management sites using Ruby on Rails, and create exceedingly fast and flexible web apps where security is key via the Django web framework for Python.</p>

                                        <p>I produce responsive web designs that are suitable for a modern web accessed via many different types and sizes of device, such as TVs, mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers.</p>
                                        <p>I believe the best design comes from establishing problems specific to a project then solving them in the simplest way possible. I design to achieve the aims of your project (increasing sales/user-base etc) whilst also providing users with a quality experience during their interaction with your product.</p>
                                        <p>My design process involves:</p>
                                        <ol class="resumeList">
                                            <li><strong>Research</strong> – Determining what a client aims to achieve, who competitors are, what a client’s current website achieves, who uses the current website and the problems they face, etc</li>
                                            <li><strong>Wireframing</strong> – Rapid design of the most effective layouts for a website/application</li>
                                            <li><strong>Mockups</strong> – Application of colour, typography, texture etc</li>
                                            <li><strong>Brand Guidelines</strong> – Where necessary, I provide brand guidelines and style guides that ensure my designs can easily be maintained and consistently applied elsewhere throughout the life-cycle of a product</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>When designing I involve clients in the process as much as possible so they can give feedback and to ensure what I produce is meeting their expectations.</p>
                                        <p>My preferred design applications are Adobe Photoshop &amp; Illustrator, and Inkscape.</p>
